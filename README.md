Technology stack used: HTML, CSS, JS, EJS, nodeJS, postgreSQL, Docker, VSCode as IDE

Application prereqs: If you are running the website off of the deployment link, nothing needs to be done. If you are running the website locally, you will have to download Docker, launch "docker compose up" while within All_Project_code_and_resources in the terminal, then you may open the website from a browser (preferably Chrome) on local host 3000.

Running tests: Change the command line in the docker-compose file to "npm run testandrun". Restart Docker and you should see test results in the terminal.
